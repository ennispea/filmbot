    "good": ["Excellent movie with lots of action, shooting and stunt driving. ","Was told to watch this so I did and was very pleased. ","Would purchase again----do recommend watching it. ","I ordered this for my grandson. I had it delivered to him and he was very pleased with it. ","Some of the stunts are a little far fetched but that goes with the movie making territory. ","full of action. ","good effects. ","for your entertainment and popcorn. ","If you haven't seen the movie. OMG, it is amazing. ","AWESOME!!! I love how this movie is very aware of what it is and never try and take itself to seriously. ","I thought it was very well done. ","Was scared after some of the bad reviews but so glad I bought it. ","My kid and I loved it. ","I'm sure it will be watched over and over again. ","The movie came in a timely fashion with no dents, dings or scratches. ","The movie was surprisingly good. ","Love this movie and binge watched it over and over. ","The story in this is nothing like what the previews hint at and quite interesting to watch. ","Very interesting movie. ","Insightful. ","It was suggested by a friend and I'm glad I got it. ","A little quirky but I like that. ","After all these years, this is still one of my favorite movies of all times. ","It is just as enthralling as it was the first time I watched. ","It's not a film for everyone. ","I'd heard about this film for a long time; so glad I bought and viewed it. It was well worth my time. ","My favorite movie of all time in one of the most nicely designed covers I've seen. ","What a treasure. ","This wonderful film holds up year after year. ","Still wonderful after all these years. ","This is a great movie for selected audiences who happen to be in the right mood for it. ","I've seen this movie several times, and I always enjoy it. ","It is a fascinating movie, but you must concentrate because the movie is pure conversation, and if you get distracted at all you'll miss something. ","This surely isn't a film for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. ","As for the movie itself, I'm taking the time to write these remarks because it's a great movie that is well worth watching and watching again. ","At a time in my life, this crystallized everything that I was thinking at that time. ","It is like what you think as a gown up. ","I was afraid it was going to be indeed of very bad quality but I was pleasantly surprised. ","Great 2 DVD pack and nice booklet.","excellent fun movie for its uniquness. ","This is a movie I watch when I don't know HOW to think anymore. ","if you're legal, a little marijuana will help to open up to the experience. ","I would say this is one of my top 5 favorite films. ","In my humble opinion pure genius. ","This film under rated. ","it is a highly intellectual film and not a popcorn and cola blockbuster. ","This is not for everyone. ","It is slow, studied and you can watch it once every year or two. ","The message was and is brilliant. ","This is an outstanding movie that is simply not made any more, except by some student at Sundance. ","If you miss this movie, you will miss out on seeing a brilliant artistic thoroughly entertaining gem. ","This is the kind of movie one should see every six months or so..... ","I get something out of it every time I see it, and it brings me right into the present. ","It is brilliant. ","One of the most fascinating and enjoyable movies I've ever seen. ","I saw it when it first came out in the theaters, and have watched it periodically during the years since, when I get really hungry for something interesting. ","Wonderful thought provoking movie. ","Watch when you're in a contemplative mood, questioning man's alienation from the natural environment. ","A wonderful movie. ","Love it!!!! ","I've watched it many times & will in the future too. ","I need 4 more words for this review - Great, wonderful, buy it! ","I try to watch this once a year - it helps me to re-focus on what is important in life. ","Quite possible the strangest film I've ever seen. ","Fantastic. Put it on prime instant streaming ","Amazing watch, dripping with symbolism and meaning, this is not your average movie. ","The first time I've ever watched a movie all the way through, and promptly started it again from the beginning. ","A transformative meditation of the soul. ","So beautiful but most importantly, it shows you as the spectator the beauty that lies within. ","Well done. Thanks! ","The film is philosophical and heavily allegorical. ","It is well made and the quality of the film stock is immaculate considering when it was filmed. ","Simply put, quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. ","Some might find it's lack of a clearly stated plot frustrating, but it operates on the consistently strange logic of it's visionary director. ","Having heard it was an intensely influential film for many other artists I decided to check it out and was not disappointed. ","A very surreal movie. ","Know what you're getting into before purchasing, because this is truly an abnormal movie. ","The strangest movie I have ever seen, and that is good! ","cute flick, great for 1st dates ","I regret not watching it sooner. ","It's a mind blowing piece of art. ","Gorgeous. Good captions, too. ","Very interesting movie. ","Definitely not for the faint of heart. ","Excellent! ","Great movie, excellent quality ","Masterful indeed. ","very visually entertaining. ","A Great movie, This should be the standard for all erotica movie's. ","The quality and the movie content did not disappoint. ","best film , sexiest females. ","If Your A Fan Dont Miss This One. ","This is one of the best of movies ever made I love this movie ","FUN STUFF ","thank you very fast and nice. ","great movie great movie. ","Has own rating: Good. ","Another cable memory. ","It was a great show. ","Great movie for adults. ","I've had this in VHS format before, and now have it in dvd. ","Very good flick. Recommend it highly. ","5.0 out of 5 starsExactly what I want.. ","Years ago I saw this movie and was thrilled to find it again. ","Perfect tantalizing tale without blood, gore or strange twists. " ,"I've searched for this movie for years. ","The movie is exactly like I remember, soft porn with alittle British humor. ","An erotic softcore romp with no pretentions of being anything beyond that. ","This movie was tastefully done in times gone by. ","Helpful for 'mood'. ","Not like old time x rated movies of past times. ","Was just what I was looking for , and found it. ","One of my favorite films from the time period. ","It is everything I remembered it was when I saw it on VHS. ", "Low budget movie with quite good effects for the time. ","I really like the props in this movie. It's quite realistic. ","The actor's performance was animated and devoted. ","The film is ok. ","The plot of the film feels very close to reality. ","I think the movie would be better if it ended a little bit more sad. ","I watched this video with my brother. ","The special effects of the film are really good. ","Bleakly atmospheric, but low budget and slow moving. ","Does a nice job of conveying the weary hopelessness of its characters and until a somewhat sloppy, although poignant, ending, it generally plays by the rules. ","Overall, a nice, solid time-waster that just suffers from a lack of ambition. ","A Future Cult Classic. ","A good strong story line that keeps you guessing with the usual low budget effects from a non-mainstream blockbuster. ","For fun, great fx and great plot, this is a great rental! ","The R rating comes from sci/fi violence and terror, language and some quick nudity... in a rather funny scene, but this film is pretty well suitable for all. ","No matter who you are you will love this movie! ","its been so long since a seen this movie, it is great to get it on DVD and watch it again, great movie! ","Had to buy this as i had seen it as a child. ","Good film quality, as advertised. ","It has become a family favourite! ","A feel good extravaganza ","A wonderful, feel good, any age film to enjoy. ","INSPIRATIONAL ","I watched this as a child at my Nan's house and have watched it every year since!! ","Such a beautiful film :) ","My grandkids loved this film great they watched it twice before they got picked up ","It was nice to see it again Thank you ","Lovely film. It was nice to see it again ","A great classic, my 7-year old son loved it. ","Wonderful memories ","Great movie ","Verty good film.seen it lots of time ","One of the best films I have ever seen, suits all ages, a great family film ,I would recommend to every one. ","It is, without question, one of the loveliest films I have seen in years. " ,"And it is, without question, the film I have been recommending all ages to see. ","Pure delight. ","Why, oh why, didn't I know about the film when it originally came out. ","Everyone should see it. ","FIRST CLASS FILM SPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO ENJOY ","I am happy with it and I will give you 12 out of 12 ","Kids loved it. 10 and 5 year old. I thought it was great too. ","Really enjoYedingham it my daughters liked it to really good film ","Stunning nightmare world. ","Music and acting exacting right - sometimes purposefully ham to add to the plot. ","Sensual and strange. ","See 'Enemy' for a similar mood. ","Weird, wonderful, and able to get completely under your skin. ","Others have written much better reviews of the film itself. ","The plot is strange, non-linear and thought provoking but incredibly hard to explain, but just expect to be amazed. ","The performances are excellent........ ","I love the thought that the different interpretations of this film would emerge each time you viewed it. ","I couldn't recommend it more and inspires me to rent more films. ","Yet again, another fantastic film by my favourite director. ","If you love bizarre, surreal and ambiguous films, that are well-crafted, sinister, and wonderfully acted, then I highly recommend you go and buy this film. ","So what was that all about? ","It is so dark and brooding that you will be in the land of nod in no time at all. ","As far as content on the DVD goes it is pretty shocking...... ","The film would be ruined if you did know what was going on, so the absence of a 'making of' featurette is welcomed. ","A commentary would have been nice but I suspect it would have been mostly silence. ","A profound, life-changing experience. ","The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. ","if you take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still take dozens of viewings to even begin solving it. ","A critical and box office catastrophe on release, it has in recent years thankful been reassessed in some quarters. ","This is a film where all the elements are alive for the viewer. ","The sound design is meticulously thoughtout to help build the mood and every single shot is just gorgeously framed. ","Magnificent direction and a haunting soundtrack. ","Before you watch it, ask yourself whether you're willing to invest over two hours of your life in a film where you have to research it afterwards to truly understand it. ","I confess that I did have to look towards the internet to finally determine what it was all about. ","It is certainly enjoyable, even though it's brutal, sadistic and violent. ","You have to be in the mood for something (more than) a little different. ", "I loved the movie. ","I bought the movie on account of the music from the movie. ","Well, I fell in love with the movie and with the music I love, I was in heaven. ","I recommend this movie to young and old and I am 73 years old! ","Fun watch! ","Super sweet movie. ","Funny and awesome to enjoy with the whole family. ","Loved it ","Brought back my perfect childhood memories ","I usually try to find free streams of movies online but could not find this movie with good quality (or one at all). ","Great quality! ","hilarious ","My granddaughter loved it! ","Great feel-good movie ","Great feel-good movie. ","For once, the fine actors and the family story add to the film. ","Good for the very young. Highly recommended. ","Cute movie, my kids enjoyed it very much. ","There was one scene which is inappropriate for young children so if your kids are under 10 or so be prepared for questions. ","A+ Family Movie ","This is a great family movie. ","I have no clue why someone would say it is not suitable for children. That is crazy. ","You can rest assured this movie is great for the entire family. ","Our grandchildren LOVE it. ","Unfortunately the part about the 'wiener', gets repeated and referenced by family way too many times long after the movie is over and that is unfortunate. ","Good movie for kids to watch. ","My 5 year old daughter laughed her butt off watching this movie. ","All ages enjoy this movie! ","One of our favorite family movies of all time! ","Our girls enjoyed it very much. ","A greatwatch with the kids ","We own 2 St. Bernards and my wife and I watched it with them. they thought it was great! Me too! ","Great family movie! ","Love this movie ;) ","My 7 year old loved it! ","Classic! My 7 year old loved it!! ","I have had to watch it over and over again. ","Kids never get tired of this movie. ","love it ","Just plain fun ","An epic with lush views, great acting and one of the best movie scores ever. ","Lush epic, good acting and the most wonderful music. ","I would have given six (6) stars just for the music. ","This film is definitely a gem amongst films. ","Story wise,Acting wise,soundtrack...... excellent. ","It's a multifaceted meaningful storyline, where A man can start & were fate may place him. ","A journey of the heart & the soul. ","If you have not seen this movie see it, then I am pretty sure you will add this to your collection. ","I consider this an excellent buy!. ","this is an amazing movie. ","epic and heart-wrenching. ","you will be completely drawn in by the strong characters and their struggle. ","it is a beautiful movie - with fantastic music. ","Great movie - great music - setting was beautiful - great/sad story. ","Excellent movie. Engaging and riveting! ","An unbelievable and mesmerizing epic motion picture that was sadly, a historical fact. ","This is one very powerful movie which exhibits the passionate extremes of good and evil, love and lust, greed and generosity, spirituality verses power and position, and the all consuming and life changing, freedom verses unwarranted bondage. ","A memorable epic that leaves a moving impression. ","gift for a friend ","I first saw this thought-provoking film on the big screen in 70mm and believed it to be one of the best films. ","Unfortunately the film opened to disappointing business in the U.S. but did much better in Europe. ","Many people thought this to be a religious film but it is far more than that. Rather to divulge a lot about the plot, I would rather imply that this film is a triumph in the sense that it is action filled spectacle that makes us think rather than just entertain us. ","Anyway do see this film for the direction, the stars and of course, the evocative score. ","Though the transfer is superb, the sound is a little disappointing, it lacks the spaciousness of how it was in the theater. ","Wonderful Movie! ","Maybe the best movie. ","You do not want to miss this ","This is one of the most beautiful, moving movies I have ever seen in my life. ","I admit that I am normally disinterested in awards given to movies, but this one was deserving of all the homage paid to it. ","It is one of the most well-done movies I have ever seen, and the cinematography ranks up there with 'Dances With Wolves' and The Last Of The Mohicans. ","In a word, this movie is unforgettable. ","A friend told me it was her favorite video and had been lost. I ordered it as a gift for her and she was so happy she cried. ","best movie ever. ","I pray God finds this movie and jesus christ shows his mercy. ","very good movie ","The movie was excellent - THE SOUND QUALITY WAS TERRIBLE ","Not to be Confused with Cheerleader Massacre ","How might it be that I've remained uninformed for so long, about this shitefest of genius lunacy? ","I admit I popped one when I watched it. ","One would be forgiven for erroneously entertaining the idea that it's a movie of absolutely no worth. ","to judge it by conventional standards only reveals a less than willing mind state. ","I mean, you have to be some kind of glutton for punishment to sit through the entire thing. ","There remains no denying that this no budget production has leftfield moments of absolute hilarity. ","I must be some kind of masochist because I actually think I'm going to try to watch it again! ","A KEEPER. ","excellent ","This film is great. ","It is smart and sexy. ","Thank you all for this beautiful piece of art cinema. ","If you are a fan of dicks and a lover of sharks you are in for a real treat! ","High brow and low brow at teh same time ","The slow motion shots were amazingly beautiful. ","I love this style. ","Sweet and innocent. ","Brilliant absurdity with a vulgar display of intellect. ","It's brash, with glorious nudity, the trademark score and humorous dialog. ","For those that wish to dive deeper, oh my, what a journey you have before you. ","The underlying themes touch on a number of philosophical maxims and the film will reward those who embrace the thin veneer of sarcasm. ","It this film perfect? No. Is it awesome? Yes. ","If you dig underground movies with the pulsing vein of Zappa thumping through it - buy this. ","It's beyond awesome.", "Film is a little cheesy, but it has a impact on me. ","Brilliant cd of the soundtrack from a great film is available. ","Very good to watch and very enjoyable make feel young. ","this is to replace the one i had before after standing on it wonderful DVD! ","Bought for my Mum, she loves it. Inexpensive way to make an older Lady happy. ","Really excellent film enjoyed every miñute of it. I have watched it twice so far. ","It was great to see this agin after so many decades! ","Glad that I was able to buy the film. ","Make sure you have a box of tissues close by! ","Great film, sad story. ","I use this as a teaching application to adults on morality and ethics. ","Excellent movie...! ","Very pleased!!!!!!! ","A haunting, deep movie..","It is a movie both about the pathos and anxiety of each individual, and of the agony and evil of a world gone mad. ","A haunting film well worth watching but not an easy watch, the final scene is just unbelievable and even after all these years I still can't watch it. ","it will break your heart. ","It is a very powerfully moving movie! ","The movie holds your interest right up until the end. ","Not many movies I've seen could carry away a top rating. ","This movie has some fine little details in the editing as well that only caught my eye after repeated viewing. ","Its truly heartrending and must be every mother's worst nightmare...","Totally absorbing... loved it. ","I absolutely loved this film when I watched it for the first time and each time I watch it I am still in awe of the talent on the screen. ","A totally unforgettable and moving film. ","Wonderful film. ","Saw it when it was first released years ago and enjoyed even more this time around. ","The dramatic and sad story is in itself fascinating, but first and foremost, the film is a triumph of acting genius. ","Buy it if you care about great acting if for no other reason. ","First time when I saw this movie in a theatre I was stunned to see its end. ","I still am rendered speechless whenever I watch it at home. Worth owning, and watching. ","This is a wonderful film which truly brings the reality. ","Film a little long winded, but the end is heartbreaking. ","Well worth a watch. ","My little one loves this films. ","Personally I didn't find the storyline anywhere near as engaging and fun as other films, but try telling that to a toddler! ","It's bright, loud and fast and that is good enough for me! ","Great fun film for all family. ","Highly recomended, not just for film fans, has some nice socuial bits. ","Perfect Xmas present for our 8 year old film fanatic nephew. ","Great film all round!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Long awaited for and thoroughly enjoyed by the children. ","I am sure my son will love this a a Crimbo present. ","Much enjoyed by the whole family! ","Good film, even greater in 3D. ","Excellent product. ","Also, it came well packaged will make a nice Xmas present. ","Films have been deterorating in quality as time progresses but it's still enjoyable. ","Little boy loved this film as he's a film fanatic, Seen it 3 times can't wait to get it for him on DVD. ","Saw this with my 8 year old film-mad son and 6 year non-film mad daughter at the cinema in 3D. We all absolutely loved it.  ","My daughter enjoyed the prominence of the ''girl'' in the story. ","My son adores ANYTHING on film and always has. ","I loved the story - and how it linked in with other movies. ","My son asks me daily when this is coming out on dvd. ","If you have a film fan in your family I'm sure they will love it! ","Brilliant film, can watch it over and over again. ","One of my favourite films, can be watch over & over and never tire of it.!","Still love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ","Excellentbrilliant i have seen the film 6 times have the dvd on every day at some time!

","Superb soundtrack, ","Brought this for my mum she loves it. ","Very good film. ","exerlent liket lt a lot!!!!!??? ","Quite possibly the greatest film of all time. ","It's a fantastic cult classic! ","To be honest I didn't really need this on BluRay, but I went for it. ","I love this film, and I always have. ","Fantastic acting, amazing directing and brilliant story. ","One of the best films ever made, and amazon was selling it at a very low price. WIn win. ","If you haven't seen it then I suggest that you watch it. I will even send you a copy. ","I'm a huge fan of films but just never got round to watching this. Finally did and I understand why so many people think its a cult classic. ","The cast is awesome with everybody and so are the others. ","The plot twists and turn until all the stories somehow work together. ","The comedy is brilliant - as it always is from best films. ","Ultra cool pop culture phenomenon and worthy of all praise routinely bestowed upon it. ","Spawning a host of iconic lowlife characters and famously substantially enhancing the career prospects of all involved. ","The Blu-Ray looks good and features loads of extras. ","Such a classic film!! ","Watched it again for the first time in years. It's still cool as f...!! ","all the actors are on their A game. ","It's still super cool and relevant over 20 years later!!! ","Highly recommend!!! ","Ihadn't seen it before (really!) and was waiting for all the violence I'd been told it contained. Still waiting, lol. ","it was a good film, but then, anything on film can't be all bad, can it. ","I don't need to review this film, everyone in the world know's it's excellent. ","Suffice to say the packaging and delivery were superb..","A great movie with a great cast, another quality film,,","well worth watching easy to recommend... ","Score calculated using a genuine algorithm. ","Can never be beaten nothing has even come close, such epic story epic plots Eric characters`!!!!!!","Cracking multi-stranded film. ","Great dialogue and wonderful soundtrack. ","What can I say? It's a classic. ","Can watch it again and again. ","This has never and probably will never ever disappoint! ","This box set had me grinning from ear to ear ! ","It's one for the fans and the added extras are fantastic :) ","Must own if you love films. ","Love this movie. ","Enjoyable. ","Brilliant!  ","Great film??!!! ","alright. ","Very interesting film. Enjoyed it. ","Entertaining film well worth watching despite seeing it so many times.

    "bad": ["Don't even bother. ","This DVD would not play on my system. ","Had low video quality. ","Not a fan but I got it for my wife to view while recuperating from foot surgery. Even she turned it off. ","The character's aren't well developed. The plot isn't very good either. ","The movie is very boring. ","The movie sends the message that it isn't as worthy as being a career woman. ","Dead Poets Society has always been my favourite film and this film looked like it was based on that to quite a great extent. ","I saw this film and I absolutely hated every minute of it. ","This film isnt moving or feel-good, it is stupid, implausible and didn't acheive anything. ","The plot is too simple - everything is spelt out to you in black and white and the stryline is just completely unbelievable. If you loved Dead Poets Society, don't buy this. ","If you haven't seen it- DONT BUY THIS! ","This film is not a portrait of the individual characters but simply a theme using characters. ","The emotional transitions are non existent. ","We can not see why certain characters change. ","This film was conceived and executed in the way a Junior High School play with no adult writer or director does. ","Do not waste your time on this film! You will thank me... ","A waste of genuine talent ","Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast. ","Of course, the real problem with this film is that it's too self-consciously 'worthy' and seems to be begging for an Oscar in almost every scene. ","Although there are a couple of scenes where the film comes alive, it's too few and far between, and once you've left the theatre and look back on it you realise what a shallow exercise it was. ","Disappointing..... ","This movies was extremely disappointing. ","There were no transistion in the characters emotional evolution. ","There is no emotional substance in this film. ","There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. ","Save your money and better yet your time and go see another movie. ","This is not an good movie. ","The acting was dull and I didn't care for any of the girls. ","Even the music and the picture was horrible simply awful. ","Why did I waste time and money on this boring and unrealstic romance film. ","I hated every minute of this crappy movie. ","Nothing was cool and it was way too long. ","BORING is the word for this sorry exuse for a film. ","I really don't see the point about making this awful and dull movie. ","I rather eat durt then see it ever agin. ","It's simply the most boring I have ever seen in my entire life period. ","STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs. ","Nothing was good and I hated everything about it. ","I don't give a rats ass about the characters for that matter. ","Simply awful and dull. ","When movie first came out wanted to see soo bad. ","the plot was SO bad it would go from one scene to the next and leave you totally confuesed. ","the dialoge was one the worst i have ever seen. ","one of the actress.an involved Lisiban/ prostution lifestyle. and on a top of that a ton of sick sexual conversations were going on the sad part was that. they picked some wonderful actress in this movie if they just would left out those scenes and the storyline that people follow it would been much better. ","it was as bad as my dead grandmothers dentures! ","i rented this movie thinking that it would be the perfect chic flick movie to settle me into the weekend. ","i knew not to expect an intelligent movie, but i very disappointed. ","horrible movie. ","pretty actresses without much of a plot to deliver. ","if you want to waste two hours, this is a good, albeit unbeneficial, way to do it. ","no direction to this movie whatsoever. ","i was left wondering, so this is it? ","it's pure fluff. ","i'm sorry, i'm not a genuine movie critic, but i'm telling you as a regular, everyday, just-want-to-watch-a-movie-to-relax, kind of person- this movie is pointless. ","I SPENT AOLMOST THREE HOURS SEEING SOMETHING COPYING A MOVIE I LIKED AND NOT VERY WELL. ","I DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. ","IT NEVER REACHED A GOOD POINT. ","ALSO THE SPECIAL FEATURES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. ","I HATED IT AND THINK PEOPLE EVERY WHERE SHOULD BURN IT! ","Most of the acting was very cardboard. ","Oh, did I fail to point out that the title is mentioned throughout the movie at least eleventy-billion times? ","I don't remember why I rented this movie. ","I also couldn't understand why this movie was made. ","What message is this movie trying to transmit? I have no idea. ","The movie lacked one thing. Flesh. Sex. ","This movie is the biggest load of BS I've seen in years. ","The script is incredibly weak and tremendous young actors are wasted. ","It was bad acting. ","The film is a collection of wall-to-wall, highly erroneous cliches and stereotypes. ","OUCH!!! ","This is yet another example of Hollywood's liberal attacks on America's most popular decade. ","The premise is pure crap, and the characters are ridiculous parodies. The really offensive thing is that it's basically an attack on an entire ethnic group -- white, anglo-saxon protestant women. ","I don't think this is a 'chick flick' at all. ","The way it was acted out was boring and the story was all over the place. ","If you are trying to gain a few brownie points by renting a nice chick flick for your significant other, whatever you do, do not torture yourself with this mess. ","It's not romantic. No nudity or even partial anything. ","Total lack of pretty sets or scenery. ","Clothes are way conservative and non-revealing. ","Officially zero car chases and/or explosions. ","Do whatever it takes to get out of sitting through this: fake sickness, cut yourself, fake taking an important call on your cell, volunteer to do household chores. Anything! ","Like garlic to a vampire, you should keep this dvd way far away from your dvd player. ","There's really very little to recommend this film. ","The word 'lackluster' isn't quite strong enough to describe what has been put together. ","There are plenty of movies out there with nothing to say, but this one has achieved a rare, almost perfect hollowness. ","What is so profoundly annoying about this film is that it pretends to be about non-conformism, a 'dare to be yourself' movie, but it dares absolutely nothing. ","I was having a hard time remembering it twenty minutes after I left the theater. ","Guys if you are forced to watch this movie fake a serious illness or better yet fake death. ","If your woman doesn't kill you this movie will. ","Run for the hills men I'm still trying to recuperate. ","it was terrible... ","it was boring... ","don't buy this ... ","it isn't funny, and doesn't have a gripping plot ","A complete waste of time. ","This movie is really BAD. ","The acting is horrible and the overall plot is crap.

","Wasn't impressed. ","It doesn't have subtitles or other languages I would like to get a refund. ","This movie is a joke. Can't even say anything else at this point. ","The quality of this movie was horrible and even though we have great internet service this movie would pause every 10 mins on us and restart it to the beginning. ","sucked. ","Movie is good but DVD skips. ","It's dumb fun and silly. That is the plus. ","I'm very close to just giving up movies all together. They'd rather scam fans than give them what they truely want. ","If you value your time, don't waste your energy watching this movie. ","Much of the movie was ridiculous and unrealistic that it just feels like numbing entertainment in the dumbing down of society. ","Seriously it's that bad... I literally feel like I lost several IQ points watching this movie. ","It's all action to the point that it's things that defy all logic and could never possibly happen. ","It's just a movie that would appeal to those who get off on watching action instead of a movie that makes sense and has actual substance to it. ","Can't recommend it at all. ","I think I'm a bit irritated that I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. ", "This film is devoid of humour, pacing or any other redeeming features so I switched it off after 25 minutes to save on my electricity bill.

","The worst film I have EVER seen 😳 ","This has to be the worse film i have ever seen,save your money honest, its a big pile of steaming dino dung.

","Rubbish ","Not even offensive enough to not be very boring ","I started watching this one afternoon when I was home sick. I got about 15mins in. ","Not only was the script clunky, badly delivered and honestly just a bit offensive; it was boring. ","This is almost the epitome of a movie where the cast and crew are there for the pay checks. ","There is no chemistry, the acting oscillates between manic grins and paralysed wood and even the clothes are bland. ","I can't recommend enough not bothering to watch this film. ","the film makers assumed the viewers are brainless. ","I thought this film would be much more sophisticated but it is in fact very primitive. ","It hurst to watch it! ","Much like a pair of corduroy bell bottoms, this should NEVER have been made. ","This is an appalling film. ","It is offensive. ","It is offensive in every way you could possibly imagine it to be. ","watch anything else. Literally anything. ","This film is the sort of thing you hope future generations never find, what would they think of us? ","The story line is weak and there is too much focus on fashion. ","I was so disappointed with it. ","I saw this at the cinema and had no intention to get the DVD but bought it as a gift, and as they already had it I kept it. ","it was fluff ","Dreadful! ","Harmless fluff. ","the plot was as thin as cheap loo roll. ","Bad bad bad. ","I'd ask for my money back but it at least gave me the chance to have a good rant! ","Seriously though, avoid this film! ","this film was wrong on so many levels, let me elaborate: ","Did anyone notice how aweful, wooden, awkward and stiff the acting was? ","The characters seemed to be acting like strangers towards each other, it just seemed so artificial, so awkward ","I actually felt myself sinking into my seat watching this in the cinema. ","Highly repetitive and just not funny. ","The acting is generally wooden, especially the young guy. ","I bought a copy for the cost of three good takeaway meals some years ago, I resold it for pennies. ","Boring cult movie that doesn't do much with what it's got ","I didn't care for it as I struggled to finish it. ","A very unengaging light weight semi-story, weakly underdeveloped characters and a pointless conclusion. ","A great film it is not. ","The majority of the movie is made up of uneventful languors. ","a long plateau of nothing. ","Okay, so it has very little to no plot. ","Sadly it's a character piece without well realised characters. ","Maybe it's just me, but I didn't pick up many signs in the writing or acting of interesting, independent people interacting together on screen. ","The sum total of all the characters can be covered in a few simple broad-stroke descriptions. ","These are not complex characters full of enigmatic depths and surprises. ","I thought the film's conclusion was badly handled as it left me less than satisfied. ","It felt botched, lacking any pathos, any impact. ","A pointless film topped off with an even more pointless ending. ","I did not enjoy the film at all. ","It was a struggle to complete it and it definitely wasn't worth the effort. ","I can imagine the film could be delightful if you can get on its wavelength, but it's clearly not for me. ","Some funny blips in a sea of underwritten banality is not enough. ","Not merely a bad film, but a very bad film. ","I was recommended the film by a friend but found it boring and not in the least funny. Don't buy iy? ","This wasn,t for me and no matter how many times i watched it i couldn,t get a grip of it. Crazy and over the place in my opinion. ","sorry, i don't think this film is as good as everyone claims, i found it boring and uninsightful ","My girlfriend and I recently saw this in the Mayfair library. Well we did not even stay until this pile of rubbish ended. I rest my case. ","Quirky yes .. but I cannot recommend it! ","This is truly awful film. I have no words to describe it. ","This is a bad bad movie! ","I bought this for a bit of nostalgia for myself and the missus. Unfortunately watching it as an adult was a different experience. ","not a good film ","I can make head nor tail of it. ","Awful. ","Definitely NOT recommended. ","Maybe therea something wrong with me but I just didn't get it. ","aWFULL ","Incredibly dated with no strong female roles or dialogue. ", "Ive never seen this movie. Someone must be using my account again. ","boring, basic theme has already been done ad infinitum. ","Couldn't even stand to watch past the first 20 mins, boring as it was. ","Still rubbish ","Bought this because it was cheap and haven't seen it since it was at the the theatres. Now I remember why I never bought it. ","Poor acting, marginal plot, action that is meaningless. ","All the actors are capable of much more. ","The acting was, to me, Sophomoric. ","The story was in my opinion, close to alien. ","A waste of money. ","I truly expected a great movie. and it did not meet my expectations. ","One of the worst pieces of crap I have ever seen ","Then there is something like this that is boring, needlessly gory, and complete un-entertaining. ","was not good like to get my 2.99 back ","One of the WORST movies ever created in all time. ","This is just darkness, with stupid stuff happening. ","IDon't waste your time with this, unless you want fall asleep because it does a great job for that. ","No idea what was going on ","Got bored one day looking for something to do so started watching this. ","Have to say this must be one of the worst films I've seen ","Dialogue was DREADFUL, acting poor and couldn't possibly comment on the special effects as I couldn't see them. ","Save your money! ","The screen writers must be 12 year olds. ","I realize the actors all have living expenses to pay, but they should hang their heads for being involved with this turkey. ","Booooo!!! ","Don't waste your hard earned $ on this trash! ","I should have listened... ","I read several reviews prior to purchasing this movie that warned that it was not very good. Boy, were they right. ","I initially thought (and hoped) that it was the kind of bad that was actually good...in a B-movie, campy sort of way. I was sorely mistaken. ","I would not call it a ''bad'' movie...that leaves too much to the imagination (I've seen plenty of ''bad'' movies that were great fun). ","I think it is appropriate to call it ''excruciatingly mediocre.'' ","To the four-star and five-star crowd...did you see the same movie I saw? ","I didn't have high expectations ","This movie was just a complete waste of time. Period. ","this one was a real nose-picker. ","I think the most annoying problem with the movie is nearly _everything_ happens in dark corridors and rooms. ","Give this film a pass--it's not even worth the DVD to pirate it. ;>  ","hard pass. ","I'm not a film-purist but... ","As much as I like ''movies made to win oscars'', I equally love mindless action, serious drama, teen comedies and the odd slasher/parody flick.  ","I literally wanted to RUN out of the movie theatre, wishing I had just used the money to light a cigarette with. ","I sat through the movie, excited...waiting for ''the part'' where all hell breaks loose and the carnage unleashes... ","I'm tempted to believe the average episode of ''The X-Files' is shot on a bigger budget with better production values. ","Even Buffy is more visceral than this! ","The camera is too jerky...maybe its supposed to disorient you or I don't know what... ","Isn't the least bit funny... ","I had huge expectations from this movie. ","Not even worth renting. ","It's just a big...disappointment. ","This is the kind of movie you watch and walk out of a theatre saying, ''Hell, I could make a better movie than this.'' ","the filmmakers just didn't understand what they had their hands on here. ","I just don't know what they were thinking. ","the movie is a bore. ","There's a lazy attempt at story and an abandoned attempt at character development. They seem to have forgotten everything else. ","a failed film in its own right. ","Apparently, somebody was digging for.. something.. ","Look. I can't keep you from seeing the movie. ","if you are morbidly curious, or if you just absolutely have to spend that ten bucks, then go for it. ","don't come crying to me when you end up hating yourself for watching it. ","DON'T BUY IT IF YOU LIVE IN THE USA!!! ","Why can't I give it a ''0''?! ","deceitful and ludicrous!!! ","Total waste of money ","YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!! ","this should have had a ''best by..'' date on it. ","Too much talking lol ","the quality of the movie was poor, even though it says HD ","Impossible plot. ","Unsympathetic characters. ","Bad acting. ","Ridiculous makeup. ","Just horrible. ","Unwatchable. What happened? Just aweful ","I couldn't bring myself to watch it all. ","Sooo slow and uninteresting ","Boring. ","Toooooooo Long! ","Would not have been a bad movie if they had left about half of it on the cutting room floor. ","Terrible! ","Poor story and horrible acting. ","Couldn't get into this movie. ","What a steaming pile of crap!! ","It is impossible to believe that this movie is not a farce of two of the best movies ever made... ","I saw this movie when it originally came out and thought it was terrible. ","After re-watching, I realize that it is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, such a shame. ","The plot is bad and the acting is worse. ","never, ever watch this pathetic excuse for a film. ","Worse than horrible, Really! ","In its own right, it is a horrible movie: no story worth telling, widespread overacting, a lousy cast. ","This movie is so bad that if it were completely free, no strings attached, its not worth seeing. ","I couldn't watch more than one half of the movie; it made my stomach hurt! ","This movie is utterly horrible. ","It should never have been released. ","Unbelievable. ","Not very good. ","Story was tepid. ","Stupid. ","Laughably bad. ","Avoid!! ","This movie was so atrocious I don't even know where to begin. ","Was there a script? Seemed like they made it up as they went along. ","AVOID THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE!! ","Nothing new here. ","The plot's terrible, the dialog is worse, the lame slap-stick humor is borderline offensive. ","My son said ''UGH! This is the longest movie I've ever seen in my life! Can we turn it off?'' ","The movie was vulgar, had lots of sexual references and foul language, and quite honestly wasn't that funny. ","We turned it off about 20 minutes into it...I wish I could get my money back. ","It's supposed to be a ''family'' movie but had plenty of dirty jokes and dirty references. ","Thought this would be a good movie to watch with the family, the language and constant sexual overtones was too much for the wife and kids ","its very awful and feel very disapointed ","TRASH! We turned it off ","lots of sex talk and vulgar language.....My 13 year old was embarrassed.... ","Not okay for kids of age 16 or less ","The first half of the movie is fine, but about half way through, the words being spoken by the characters dont match up with their mouth. It looks like a bad Bruce Lee movie! ","it just kept getting worse!", "Very poor quality,Chinese subtitles through out,very dark images,hard to make out the characters. ","I was very disappointed with quality. ","Colour has a magenta cast and also the sound is poor. ","I own a VHS copy of this film and can honestly say the videocassette has a clearer picture and better sound (on the HiFi tracks) than this DVD. ","I would not be surprised to find the DVD to be an unofficial (and poorly executed) copy off an old VHS cassette. ","Most disappointing. ","The quality was very poor. Was it recorded from someone else's laptop? ","I don't recommend this particular DVD to anyone - it's a waste of money. ","The DVD is such poor quality that one cannot watch it. I will put it in the waste bin. ","What a pity, its bad now. I love the film very much and I was hoping I could show the film to my children. ","This film was of exception poor quality. Do not recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ","absolute awful. Everyone had purple heads and there was splashes of purple on everyone. ","This film was of exception poor quality. Do not recommend!! ","It was dubed in Korean and the picture was very jumpy and grainy was a Xmas gift for my daughter in law.. ","Complete and utter fake. ","Very disappointed.What a pointless film. ","Had I known beforehand that it contained so much foul language I would certainly not have purchased this dvd........ ","I just couldn't get into the storyline at all, after having wasted a good half hour or so of my time. ","I didn't watch it all. ","Had I been in a cinema I would have walked out . ","I was persuaded to purchase it, but bad awful. ","This film is so terrible I want 60 minutes of my life back.  ","I can't even imagine how they raised funds to finance this. ","got this for my son as a surprise..... not a very happy customer, especially after waiting so long for it. ","Do not buy this film is Transphobic and sexist and not at all funny. ","Turned this film off not long into watching it due to the content.... ","My 10 Year had been given other PG rated film and asked for this films, after watching it.....I didn't realise this films were a '12' rating. ","The film wasn't on that long and I was sat cringing at some of the content, as I was watching with my 10 year old! ","I turned the film off!!!! ","I do not want my child watching a film were someone thinks it is ok to treat officials and other people in such a rude way and also swear at them....it is not funny! ","I wasn't too happy with the film, rude and naughty also disrespectful towards some adults especially officials. ","I have sent this film to the charity shop... ","in my opinion they should not be watched by anyone younger than 12. ","Not that good,story a it weak.. ","muscle didn't do much hear,up the the reds. ","Endless chases and smash ups. ","Pointless violence, illogical plotting and 2 dimensional acting nailed to a dire script full of groan moments. ","Strictly by-the-numbers film which effectively renders itself unnecessary. ","If this is family friendly viewing then I don't want to know those families. ","My taste in movies has changed in 50+ years - now this seems stilted and phony ","Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and actorsare overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold asicepick. ","It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing. ","Not entertaining or enlightening at all.  ","I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying anything for it, even the few pennies an online rental costs. ","looks dreadful on a widescreen set with bars both above and below and on either side. ","It's a disaster, folks. ","A drag of cliches ponderously delivered by a stellar cast who should have known better. ","The only good point is its function as a £3 makeweight to avoid a carriage charge. ","This hasn't dated well and I'm at a bit of a loss as to why other than nostalgia that this film has received so many glowing reviews. ","indeed fulll of very tasteless cheap jokes that are racially related. ","There are some humourous lines but they are rather sparse and more jokes are misses than hits. ","It was only the nostalgia factor and all the glowing reviews that made me think this was good (it sadly isn't). ","What a pity the story never really amounts to very much and all seems rather pointless at the end. ","Trust me when I say - ANYTHING IS BETTER! ","Just watch this one on TV and save yourself the price of a DVD that you'll end up giving away. ","Thought I'd love this DVD given the fantastic cast - nope. ","Whilst I'm not averse to swearing , I cringe at blasphemy and there was plenty of that !!! ","Not for me I'm afraid 😔!! ","The problem a film such as this has is that it's such a well trodden formula.  ","Film lovers continue entering such productions hoping for something different each time, but rarely is that hope met. ","The cast do fine with the flimsy material, But where's the surprises? ","Plonking formula into the middle of a film just doesn't cut it as being any different. ","It failed to make back its $10 million budget domestically but limped to a Worldwide profit of $23.5 million. ","One or two good visual gags aside, it's a poor film and frankly all those involved deserve much better. ","To say that this film was a disappointment would be an understatement of epic proportions. ","It was so poor that it had me cringing at times. ","Proof that a good cast and crew does not always make for a great film. ","For me, it seems to get caught between two stools, it's neither a great comedy, nor a great romantic comedy - there's little believeable romance and very little comedy. ","I think it took me 10 minutes to raise a smile and perhaps I laughed once throughout the film. ","What humour there was could be spotted a mile off to anyone with a half a brain...as could the entire story. ","A slight variation on a thousand of films before it, same characters, same iconic locations, same cool indie sound track. ","Perhaps I'm looking too deeply and I have to admit that this is not my kind of film to begin with. ","I fail to see any good in this film. ","Almost beyond belief that people can give this 5 stars, and I speak as a fan of other similar films. ","Embarassing story line and lame comedy, with hardly a laugh out loud moment. ","Are the people serious on here with Five stars.... ","this screenplay has been stretched so far it's not funny...... ","this has the script of a short film made into 90 plus minutes...... ","How did this get financied to be made, the story is so lame....huge disappointment. ","Not worth buying even if it is in a pound bargain bucket... ","When I went to see this film in the Cinema, I had high hopes that it would be just brilliant. Sorry but it was pretty lame.  ","I am not sure if it was a low budget film but it seem so faked up. ","Surely credible actors like these wouldn't put their names to just anything. Obviously I was wrong. ","It was so cheesy, predictable and not really that funny. ","For me it was quite painful to watch just due to the sheer predictability of it all, I could literally see what was coming throughout the film. ","There is nothing original about this - the film borrows on the concepts and ideas from hundreds of films before it - and delivers nothing. ","The front cover of the DVD shows the words 'Fantastic' ' A Comedy Gem' 'Hilarious'..... WRONG. ","This is the biggest pile of garbage I have ever watched. ","It is actually a rip off of several different movies - see if you can spot them. ","Even the bloopers are unfunny, and sometimes allegedly, staged? ","Fantastic..No. Unfunny ...yes. ","Should say on the report 'Tries hard, must do better' Stick with better films. ","I really feel that quality actors and writers have a duty to the public to turn down roles in rubbish such as this. ","It's absolutely dreadful with no redeeming qualities. ","After a while I began to wonder whether it was deliberately parodying American/English films, but reluctantly realised that it didn't even have that depth. ","No one turns in a good performance, and the tree in the park had more charisma than the actors and was even less wooden. ","Utter utter utter utter utter rubbish and a waste of everyone's time. ","A one word review of this bucket of derivative crud would be disappointing. ","Talk about a watered down film made for the mentally challenged; it was predictable and painful to watch. ","I rounded up some friends and popped the DVD on - only to have this abomination grace my screen. ","If you are a fan of generic hollywood tripe you will love it. If you have half a brain give it a miss. ","Just the director dropping his trousers for the American dollar. ","I tried to walk out in disgust but realised I was on a plane. But still tried - it's that bad. ","Even though it says the feature is a 12, it really is not suitable for that age. ","It had unnecessary swearing and was smutty just for the sake of it. ","Could have been a lot funnier and we didn't even watch to the end. ","Im shocked this movie has been so well reviewed. I thought it was terrible. ","The plot is contrived and insulting an there isnt more than a few feeble jokes in it. ","I sat in the cinema stoney faced whilst everyone around me laughed out loud and I have no idea why. ","Dull!!!!!"],
