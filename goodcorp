"Excellent movie with lots of action, shooting and stunt driving. ","Was told to watch this so I did and was very pleased. ","Would purchase again----do recommend watching it. ","I ordered this for my grandson. I had it delivered to him and he was very pleased with it. ","Some of the stunts are a little far fetched but that goes with the movie making territory. ","full of action. ","good effects. ","for your entertainment and popcorn. ","If you haven't seen the movie. OMG, it is amazing. ","AWESOME!!! I love how this movie is very aware of what it is and never try and take itself to seriously. ","I thought it was very well done. ","Was scared after some of the bad reviews but so glad I bought it. ","My kid and I loved it. ","I'm sure it will be watched over and over again. ","The movie came in a timely fashion with no dents, dings or scratches. ","The movie was surprisingly good. ","Love this movie and binge watched it over and over. ","The story in this is nothing like what the previews hint at and quite interesting to watch. ","Very interesting movie. ","Insightful. ","It was suggested by a friend and I'm glad I got it. ","A little quirky but I like that. ","After all these years, this is still one of my favorite movies of all times. ","It is just as enthralling as it was the first time I watched. ","It's not a film for everyone. ","I'd heard about this film for a long time; so glad I bought and viewed it. It was well worth my time. ","My favorite movie of all time in one of the most nicely designed covers I've seen. ","What a treasure. ","This wonderful film holds up year after year. ","Still wonderful after all these years. ","This is a great movie for selected audiences who happen to be in the right mood for it. ","I've seen this movie several times, and I always enjoy it. ","It is a fascinating movie, but you must concentrate because the movie is pure conversation, and if you get distracted at all you'll miss something. ","This surely isn't a film for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. ","As for the movie itself, I'm taking the time to write these remarks because it's a great movie that is well worth watching and watching again. ","At a time in my life, this crystallized everything that I was thinking at that time. ","It is like what you think as a gown up. ","I was afraid it was going to be indeed of very bad quality but I was pleasantly surprised. ","Great 2 DVD pack and nice booklet.","excellent fun movie for its uniquness. ","This is a movie I watch when I don't know HOW to think anymore. ","if you're legal, a little marijuana will help to open up to the experience. ","I would say this is one of my top 5 favorite films. ","In my humble opinion pure genius. ","This film under rated. ","it is a highly intellectual film and not a popcorn and cola blockbuster. ","This is not for everyone. ","It is slow, studied and you can watch it once every year or two. ","The message was and is brilliant. ","This is an outstanding movie that is simply not made any more, except by some student at Sundance. ","If you miss this movie, you will miss out on seeing a brilliant artistic thoroughly entertaining gem. ","This is the kind of movie one should see every six months or so..... ","I get something out of it every time I see it, and it brings me right into the present. ","It is brilliant. ","One of the most fascinating and enjoyable movies I've ever seen. ","I saw it when it first came out in the theaters, and have watched it periodically during the years since, when I get really hungry for something interesting. ","Wonderful thought provoking movie. ","Watch when you're in a contemplative mood, questioning man's alienation from the natural environment. ","A wonderful movie. ","Love it!!!! ","I've watched it many times & will in the future too. ","I need 4 more words for this review - Great, wonderful, buy it! ","I try to watch this once a year - it helps me to re-focus on what is important in life. ","Quite possible the strangest film I've ever seen. ","Fantastic. Put it on prime instant streaming ","Amazing watch, dripping with symbolism and meaning, this is not your average movie. ","The first time I've ever watched a movie all the way through, and promptly started it again from the beginning. ","A transformative meditation of the soul. ","So beautiful but most importantly, it shows you as the spectator the beauty that lies within. ","Well done. Thanks! ","The film is philosophical and heavily allegorical. ","It is well made and the quality of the film stock is immaculate considering when it was filmed. ","Simply put, quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. ","Some might find it's lack of a clearly stated plot frustrating, but it operates on the consistently strange logic of it's visionary director. ","Having heard it was an intensely influential film for many other artists I decided to check it out and was not disappointed. ","A very surreal movie. ","Know what you're getting into before purchasing, because this is truly an abnormal movie. ","The strangest movie I have ever seen, and that is good! ","cute flick, great for 1st dates ","I regret not watching it sooner. ","It's a mind blowing piece of art. ","Gorgeous. Good captions, too. ","Very interesting movie. ","Definitely not for the faint of heart. ","Excellent! ","Great movie, excellent quality ","Masterful indeed. ","very visually entertaining.

","This is one of the best of movies ever made I love this movie ","FUN STUFF ","thank you very fast and nice. ","great movie great movie. ","Has own rating: Good. ","Another cable memory. ","It was a great show. ","Great movie for adults. ","I've had this in VHS format before, and now have it in dvd. ","Very good flick. Recommend it highly. ","5.0 out of 5 starsExactly what I want.. ","Years ago I saw this movie and was thrilled to find it again. ","Perfect tantalizing tale without blood, gore or strange twists. " ,"I've searched for this movie for years. ","The movie is exactly like I remember, soft porn with alittle British humor. ","An erotic softcore romp with no pretentions of being anything beyond that. ","This movie was tastefully done in times gone by. ","Helpful for 'mood'. ","Not like old time x rated movies of past times. ","Was just what I was looking for , and found it. ","One of my favorite films from the time period. ","It is everything I remembered it was when I saw it on VHS. ", "Low budget movie with quite good effects for the time. ","I really like the props in this movie. It's quite realistic. ","The actor's performance was animated and devoted. ","The film is ok. ","The plot of the film feels very close to reality. ","I think the movie would be better if it ended a little bit more sad. ","I watched this video with my brother. ","The special effects of the film are really good. ","Bleakly atmospheric, but low budget and slow moving. ","Does a nice job of conveying the weary hopelessness of its characters and until a somewhat sloppy, although poignant, ending, it generally plays by the rules. ","Overall, a nice, solid time-waster that just suffers from a lack of ambition. ","A Future Cult Classic. ","A good strong story line that keeps you guessing with the usual low budget effects from a non-mainstream blockbuster. ","For fun, great fx and great plot, this is a great rental! ","The R rating comes from sci/fi violence and terror, language and some quick nudity... in a rather funny scene, but this film is pretty well suitable for all. ","No matter who you are you will love this movie! ","its been so long since a seen this movie, it is great to get it on DVD and watch it again, great movie! ","Had to buy this as i had seen it as a child. ","Good film quality, as advertised. ","It has become a family favourite! ","A feel good extravaganza ","A wonderful, feel good, any age film to enjoy. ","INSPIRATIONAL ","I watched this as a child at my Nan's house and have watched it every year since!! ","Such a beautiful film :) ","My grandkids loved this film great they watched it twice before they got picked up ","It was nice to see it again Thank you ","Lovely film. It was nice to see it again ","A great classic, my 7-year old son loved it. ","Wonderful memories ","Great movie ","Verty good film.seen it lots of time ","One of the best films I have ever seen, suits all ages, a great family film ,I would recommend to every one. ","It is, without question, one of the loveliest films I have seen in years. " ,"And it is, without question, the film I have been recommending all ages to see. ","Pure delight. ","Why, oh why, didn't I know about the film when it originally came out. ","Everyone should see it. ","FIRST CLASS FILM SPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO ENJOY ","I am happy with it and I will give you 12 out of 12 ","Kids loved it. 10 and 5 year old. I thought it was great too. ","Really enjoYedingham it my daughters liked it to really good film ","Stunning nightmare world. ","Music and acting exacting right - sometimes purposefully ham to add to the plot. ","Sensual and strange. ","See "Enemy" for a similar mood. ","Weird, wonderful, and able to get completely under your skin. ","Others have written much better reviews of the film itself. ","The plot is strange, non-linear and thought provoking but incredibly hard to explain, but just expect to be amazed. ","The performances are excellent........ ","I love the thought that the different interpretations of this film would emerge each time you viewed it. ","I couldn't recommend it more and inspires me to rent more films. ","Yet again, another fantastic film by my favourite director. ","If you love bizarre, surreal and ambiguous films, that are well-crafted, sinister, and wonderfully acted, then I highly recommend you go and buy this film. ","So what was that all about? ","It is so dark and brooding that you will be in the land of nod in no time at all. ","As far as content on the DVD goes it is pretty shocking...... ","The film would be ruined if you did know what was going on, so the absence of a "making of" featurette is welcomed. ","A commentary would have been nice but I suspect it would have been mostly silence. ","A profound, life-changing experience. ","The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. ","if you take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still take dozens of viewings to even begin solving it. ","A critical and box office catastrophe on release, it has in recent years thankful been reassessed in some quarters. ","This is a film where all the elements are alive for the viewer. ","The sound design is meticulously thoughtout to help build the mood and every single shot is just gorgeously framed. ","Magnificent direction and a haunting soundtrack. ","Before you watch it, ask yourself whether you're willing to invest over two hours of your life in a film where you have to research it afterwards to truly understand it. ","I confess that I did have to look towards the internet to finally determine what it was all about. ","It is certainly enjoyable, even though it's brutal, sadistic and violent. ","You have to be in the mood for something (more than) a little different. "
