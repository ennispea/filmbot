"Don't even bother. ","This DVD would not play on my system. ","Had low video quality. ","Not a fan but I got it for my wife to view while recuperating from foot surgery. Even she turned it off. ","The character's aren't well developed. The plot isn't very good either. ","The movie is very boring. ","The movie sends the message that it isn't as worthy as being a career woman. ","Dead Poets Society has always been my favourite film and this film looked like it was based on that to quite a great extent. ","I saw this film and I absolutely hated every minute of it. ","This film isnt moving or feel-good, it is stupid, implausible and didn't acheive anything. ","The plot is too simple - everything is spelt out to you in black and white and the stryline is just completely unbelievable. If you loved Dead Poets Society, don't buy this. ","If you haven't seen it- DONT BUY THIS! ","This film is not a portrait of the individual characters but simply a theme using characters. ","The emotional transitions are non existent. ","We can not see why certain characters change. ","This film was conceived and executed in the way a Junior High School play with no adult writer or director does. ","Do not waste your time on this film! You will thank me... ","A waste of genuine talent ","Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast. ","Of course, the real problem with this film is that it's too self-consciously 'worthy' and seems to be begging for an Oscar in almost every scene. ","Although there are a couple of scenes where the film comes alive, it's too few and far between, and once you've left the theatre and look back on it you realise what a shallow exercise it was. ","Disappointing..... ","This movies was extremely disappointing. ","There were no transistion in the characters emotional evolution. ","There is no emotional substance in this film. ","There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. ","Save your money and better yet your time and go see another movie. ","This is not an good movie. ","The acting was dull and I didn't care for any of the girls. ","Even the music and the picture was horrible simply awful. ","Why did I waste time and money on this boring and unrealstic romance film. ","I hated every minute of this crappy movie. ","Nothing was cool and it was way too long. ","BORING is the word for this sorry exuse for a film. ","I really don't see the point about making this awful and dull movie. ","I rather eat durt then see it ever agin. ","It's simply the most boring I have ever seen in my entire life period. ","STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs.

","i knew not to expect an intelligent movie, but i very disappointed. ","horrible movie. ","pretty actresses without much of a plot to deliver. ","if you want to waste two hours, this is a good, albeit unbeneficial, way to do it. ","no direction to this movie whatsoever. ","i was left wondering, so this is it? ","it's pure fluff. ","i'm sorry, i'm not a genuine movie critic, but i'm telling you as a regular, everyday, just-want-to-watch-a-movie-to-relax, kind of person- this movie is pointless.

","ALSO THE SPECIAL FEATURES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. ","I HATED IT AND THINK PEOPLE EVERY WHERE SHOULD BURN IT! ","Most of the acting was very cardboard.

","The premise is pure crap, and the characters are ridiculous parodies. The really offensive thing is that it's basically an attack on an entire ethnic group -- white, anglo-saxon protestant women. ","I don't think this is a 'chick flick' at all. ","The way it was acted out was boring and the story was all over the place. ","If you are trying to gain a few brownie points by renting a nice chick flick for your significant other, whatever you do, do not torture yourself with this mess. ","It's not romantic.

","What is so profoundly annoying about this film is that it pretends to be about non-conformism, a 'dare to be yourself' movie, but it dares absolutely nothing.

","The characters seemed to be acting like strangers towards each other, it just seemed so artificial, so awkward ","I actually felt myself sinking into my seat watching this in the cinema. ","Highly repetitive and just not funny. ","The acting is generally wooden, especially the young guy. ","I bought a copy for the cost of three good takeaway meals some years ago, I resold it for pennies. ","Boring cult movie that doesn't do much with what it's got ","I didn't care for it as I struggled to finish it. ","A very unengaging light weight semi-story, weakly underdeveloped characters and a pointless conclusion. ","A great film it is not. ","The majority of the movie is made up of uneventful languors. ","a long plateau of nothing. ","Okay, so it has very little to no plot. ","Sadly it's a character piece without well realised characters. ","Maybe it's just me, but I didn't pick up many signs in the writing or acting of interesting, independent people interacting together on screen. ","The sum total of all the characters can be covered in a few simple broad-stroke descriptions. ","These are not complex characters full of enigmatic depths and surprises. ","I thought the film's conclusion was badly handled as it left me less than satisfied. ","It felt botched, lacking any pathos, any impact. ","A pointless film topped off with an even more pointless ending. ","I did not enjoy the film at all. ","It was a struggle to complete it and it definitely wasn't worth the effort. ","I can imagine the film could be delightful if you can get on its wavelength, but it's clearly not for me. ","Some funny blips in a sea of underwritten banality is not enough. ","Not merely a bad film, but a very bad film. ","I was recommended the film by a friend but found it boring and not in the least funny. Don't buy iy? ","This wasn,t for me and no matter how many times i watched it i couldn,t get a grip of it. Crazy and over the place in my opinion.

","Don't waste your hard earned $ on this trash! ","I should have listened... ","I read several reviews prior to purchasing this movie that warned that it was not very good. Boy, were they right. ","I initially thought (and hoped) that it was the kind of bad that was actually good...in a B-movie, campy sort of way. I was sorely mistaken. ","I would not call it a ''bad'' movie...that leaves too much to the imagination (I've seen plenty of ''bad'' movies that were great fun).

","I didn't have high expectations ","This movie was just a complete waste of time. Period. ","this one was a real nose-picker.

","The camera is too jerky...maybe its supposed to disorient you or I don't know what... ","Isn't the least bit funny... ","I had huge expectations from this movie. ","Not even worth renting.

","The plot is bad and the acting is worse. ","never, ever watch this pathetic excuse for a film. ","Worse than horrible, Really! ","In its own right, it is a horrible movie: no story worth telling, widespread overacting, a lousy cast.

","This movie is utterly horrible. ","It should never have been released. ","Unbelievable. ","Not very good. ","Story was tepid. ","Stupid. ","Laughably bad. ","Avoid!!

","I was very disappointed with quality. ","Colour has a magenta cast and also the sound is poor.

","got this for my son as a surprise..... not a very happy customer, especially after waiting so long for it. ","Do not buy this film is Transphobic and sexist and not at all funny. ","Turned this film off not long into watching it due to the content.... ","My 10 Year had been given other PG rated film and asked for this films, after watching it.....I didn't realise this films were a '12' rating. ","The film wasn't on that long and I was sat cringing at some of the content, as I was watching with my 10 year old! ","I turned the film off!!!! ","I do not want my child watching a film were someone thinks it is ok to treat officials and other people in such a rude way and also swear at them....it is not funny! ","I wasn't too happy with the film, rude and naughty also disrespectful towards some adults especially officials. ","I have sent this film to the charity shop... ","in my opinion they should not be watched by anyone younger than 12. ","Not that good,story a it weak.. ","muscle didn't do much hear,up the the reds. ","Endless chases and smash ups. ","Pointless violence, illogical plotting and 2 dimensional acting nailed to a dire script full of groan moments. ","Strictly by-the-numbers film which effectively renders itself unnecessary. ","If this is family friendly viewing then I don't want to know those families. ","My taste in movies has changed in 50+ years - now this seems stilted and phony ","Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and actorsare overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold asicepick. ","It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing. ","Not entertaining or enlightening at all.  ","I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying anything for it, even the few pennies an online rental costs. ","looks dreadful on a widescreen set with bars both above and below and on either side. ","It's a disaster, folks. ","A drag of cliches ponderously delivered by a stellar cast who should have known better. ","The only good point is its function as a Â£3 makeweight to avoid a carriage charge. ","This hasn't dated well and I'm at a bit of a loss as to why other than nostalgia that this film has received so many glowing reviews. ","indeed fulll of very tasteless cheap jokes that are racially related. ","There are some humourous lines but they are rather sparse and more jokes are misses than hits. ","It was only the nostalgia factor and all the glowing reviews that made me think this was good (it sadly isn't). ","What a pity the story never really amounts to very much and all seems rather pointless at the end. ","Trust me when I say - ANYTHING IS BETTER! ","Just watch this one on TV and save yourself the price of a DVD that you'll end up giving away. ","Thought I'd love this DVD given the fantastic cast - nope. ","Whilst I'm not averse to swearing , I cringe at blasphemy and there was plenty of that !!! ","Not for me I'm afraid ðŸ˜”!! ","The problem a film such as this has is that it's such a well trodden formula.  ","Film lovers continue entering such productions hoping for something different each time, but rarely is that hope met. ","The cast do fine with the flimsy material, But where's the surprises? ","Plonking formula into the middle of a film just doesn't cut it as being any different. ","It failed to make back its $10 million budget domestically but limped to a Worldwide profit of $23.5 million. ","One or two good visual gags aside, it's a poor film and frankly all those involved deserve much better. ","To say that this film was a disappointment would be an understatement of epic proportions. ","It was so poor that it had me cringing at times. ","Proof that a good cast and crew does not always make for a great film. ","For me, it seems to get caught between two stools, it's neither a great comedy, nor a great romantic comedy - there's little believeable romance and very little comedy. ","I think it took me 10 minutes to raise a smile and perhaps I laughed once throughout the film. ","What humour there was could be spotted a mile off to anyone with a half a brain...as could the entire story. ","A slight variation on a thousand of films before it, same characters, same iconic locations, same cool indie sound track. ","Perhaps I'm looking too deeply and I have to admit that this is not my kind of film to begin with. ","I fail to see any good in this film. ","Almost beyond belief that people can give this 5 stars, and I speak as a fan of other similar films. ","Embarassing story line and lame comedy, with hardly a laugh out loud moment. ","Are the people serious on here with Five stars.... ","this screenplay has been stretched so far it's not funny...... ","this has the script of a short film made into 90 plus minutes...... ","How did this get financied to be made, the story is so lame....huge disappointment. ","Not worth buying even if it is in a pound bargain bucket... ","When I went to see this film in the Cinema, I had high hopes that it would be just brilliant. Sorry but it was pretty lame.  ","I am not sure if it was a low budget film but it seem so faked up. ","Surely credible actors like these wouldn't put their names to just anything. Obviously I was wrong. ","It was so cheesy, predictable and not really that funny. ","For me it was quite painful to watch just due to the sheer predictability of it all, I could literally see what was coming throughout the film. ","There is nothing original about this - the film borrows on the concepts and ideas from hundreds of films before it - and delivers nothing. ","The front cover of the DVD shows the words 'Fantastic' ' A Comedy Gem' 'Hilarious'..... WRONG. ","This is the biggest pile of garbage I have ever watched. ","It is actually a rip off of several different movies - see if you can spot them. ","Even the bloopers are unfunny, and sometimes allegedly, staged? ","Fantastic..No. Unfunny ...yes. ","Should say on the report 'Tries hard, must do better' Stick with better films. ","I really feel that quality actors and writers have a duty to the public to turn down roles in rubbish such as this. ","It's absolutely dreadful with no redeeming qualities. ","After a while I began to wonder whether it was deliberately parodying American/English films, but reluctantly realised that it didn't even have that depth. ","No one turns in a good performance, and the tree in the park had more charisma than the actors and was even less wooden. ","Utter utter utter utter utter rubbish and a waste of everyone's time. ","A one word review of this bucket of derivative crud would be disappointing. ","Talk about a watered down film made for the mentally challenged; it was predictable and painful to watch. ","I rounded up some friends and popped the DVD on - only to have this abomination grace my screen. ","If you are a fan of generic hollywood tripe you will love it. If you have half a brain give it a miss. ","Just the director dropping his trousers for the American dollar. ","I tried to walk out in disgust but realised I was on a plane. But still tried - it's that bad. ","Even though it says the feature is a 12, it really is not suitable for that age. ","It had unnecessary swearing and was smutty just for the sake of it. ","Could have been a lot funnier and we didn't even watch to the end. ","Im shocked this movie has been so well reviewed. I thought it was terrible. ","The plot is contrived and insulting an there isnt more than a few feeble jokes in it. ","I sat in the cinema stoney faced whilst everyone around me laughed out loud and I have no idea why. ","Dull!!!!!"
