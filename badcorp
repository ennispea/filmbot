"Don't even bother. ","This DVD would not play on my system. ","Had low video quality. ","Not a fan but I got it for my wife to view while recuperating from foot surgery. Even she turned it off. ","The character's aren't well developed. The plot isn't very good either. ","The movie is very boring. ","The movie sends the message that it isn't as worthy as being a career woman. ","Dead Poets Society has always been my favourite film and this film looked like it was based on that to quite a great extent.","I saw this film and I absolutely hated every minute of it. ","This film isnt moving or feel-good, it is stupid, implausible and didn't acheive anything. ","The plot is too simple - everything is spelt out to you in black and white and the stryline is just completely unbelievable. If you loved Dead Poets Society, don't buy this. ","If you haven't seen it- DONT BUY THIS!","This film is not a portrait of the individual characters but simply a theme using characters. ","The emotional transitions are non existent. ","We can not see why certain characters change. ","This film was conceived and executed in the way a Junior High School play with no adult writer or director does. ","Do not waste your time on this film! You will thank me... ","A waste of genuine talent ","Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast. ","Of course, the real problem with this film is that it's too self-consciously 'worthy' and seems to be begging for an Oscar in almost every scene. ","Although there are a couple of scenes where the film comes alive, it's too few and far between, and once you've left the theatre and look back on it you realise what a shallow exercise it was.","Disappointing.....","This movies was extremely disappointing. ","There were no transistion in the characters emotional evolution. ","There is no emotional substance in this film.","There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. ","Save your money and better yet your time and go see another movie.","This is not an good movie. ","The acting was dull and I didn't care for any of the girls. ","Even the music and the picture was horrible simply awful. ","Why did I waste time and money on this boring and unrealstic romance film. ","I hated every minute of this crappy movie. ","Nothing was cool and it was way too long. ","BORING is the word for this sorry exuse for a film. ","I really don't see the point about making this awful and dull movie. ","I rather eat durt then see it ever agin. ","It's simply the most boring I have ever seen in my entire life period. ","STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs. ","Nothing was good and I hated everything about it. ","I don't give a rats ass about the characters for that matter. ","Simply awful and dull.","When movie first came out wanted to see soo bad. B","the plot was SO bad it would go from one scene to the next and leave you totally confuesed. ","the dialoge was one the worst i have ever seen. ","one of the actress.an involved Lisiban/ prostution lifestyle. and on a top of that a ton of sick sexual conversations were going on the sad part was that. they picked some wonderful actress in this movie if they just would left out those scenes and the storyline that people follow it would been much better. ","it was as bad as my dead grandmothers dentures!","i rented this movie thinking that it would be the perfect chic flick movie to settle me into the weekend. ","i knew not to expect an intelligent movie, but i very disappointed. ","horrible movie. ","pretty actresses without much of a plot to deliver. ","if you want to waste two hours, this is a good, albeit unbeneficial, way to do it. ","no direction to this movie whatsoever. ","i was left wondering, so this is it? ","it's pure fluff. ","i'm sorry, i'm not a genuine movie critic, but i'm telling you as a regular, everyday, just-want-to-watch-a-movie-to-relax, kind of person- this movie is pointless.","I SPENT AOLMOST THREE HOURS SEEING SOMETHING COPYING A MOVIE I LIKED AND NOT VERY WELL. ","I DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. ","IT NEVER REACHED A GOOD POINT. ","ALSO THE SPECIAL FEATURES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. ","I HATED IT AND THINK PEOPLE EVERY WHERE SHOULD BURN IT!","Most of the acting was very cardboard. ","Oh, did I fail to point out that the title is mentioned throughout the movie at least eleventy-billion times? ","I don't remember why I rented this movie. ","I also couldn't understand why this movie was made. ","What message is this movie trying to transmit? I have no idea.","The movie lacked one thing. Flesh. Sex. ","This movie is the biggest load of BS I've seen in years. ","The script is incredibly weak and tremendous young actors are wasted. ","It was bad acting.","The film is a collection of wall-to-wall, highly erroneous cliches and stereotypes.","OUCH!!!","This is yet another example of Hollywood's liberal attacks on America's most popular decade. ","The premise is pure crap, and the characters are ridiculous parodies. The really offensive thing is that it's basically an attack on an entire ethnic group -- white, anglo-saxon protestant women. ","I don't think this is a "chick flick" at all. ","The way it was acted out was boring and the story was all over the place. ","If you are trying to gain a few brownie points by renting a nice chick flick for your significant other, whatever you do, do not torture yourself with this mess. ","It's not romantic. No nudity or even partial anything. ","Total lack of pretty sets or scenery. ","Clothes are way conservative and non-revealing. ","Officially zero car chases and/or explosions. ","Do whatever it takes to get out of sitting through this: fake sickness, cut yourself, fake taking an important call on your cell, volunteer to do household chores. Anything! ","Like garlic to a vampire, you should keep this dvd way far away from your dvd player.","There's really very little to recommend this film. ","The word "lackluster" isn't quite strong enough to describe what has been put together. ","There are plenty of movies out there with nothing to say, but this one has achieved a rare, almost perfect hollowness. ","What is so profoundly annoying about this film is that it pretends to be about non-conformism, a "dare to be yourself" movie, but it dares absolutely nothing. ","I was having a hard time remembering it twenty minutes after I left the theater.","Guys if you are forced to watch this movie fake a serious illness or better yet fake death. ","If your woman doesn't kill you this movie will. ","Run for the hills men I'm still trying to recuperate.","it was terrible... ","it was boring...","don't buy this ... ","it isn't funny, and doesn't have a gripping plot","A complete waste of time.","This movie is really BAD. ","The acting is horrible and the overall plot is crap. ","I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!!","This movie has no plot its just a long and very depressing movie.","If your a block head watch this but if your a type of person who thinks drugs are bad wait till you see this,SCARRED FOR LIFE GUARANTEED","I was expecting bad. I was satisfied. ","Wasn't impressed. ","It doesn't have subtitles or other languages I would like to get a refund.","This movie is a joke. Can't even say anything else at this point.","The quality of this movie was horrible and even though we have great internet service this movie would pause every 10 mins on us and restart it to the beginning.","sucked.","Movie is good but DVD skips.","It's dumb fun and silly. That is the plus.","I'm very close to just giving up movies all together. They'd rather scam fans than give them what they truely want.","If you value your time, don't waste your energy watching this movie. ","Much of the movie was ridiculous and unrealistic that it just feels like numbing entertainment in the dumbing down of society. ","Seriously it's that bad... I literally feel like I lost several IQ points watching this movie. ","It's all action to the point that it's things that defy all logic and could never possibly happen. ","It's just a movie that would appeal to those who get off on watching action instead of a movie that makes sense and has actual substance to it. ","Can't recommend it at all. ","I think I'm a bit irritated that I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage."
